# Research Data and Tools Repository

This repository contains all the necessary data and tools used in our research. The contents are organized into three main folders, each serving a distinct purpose:

## Folder Structure

### 1. `all_studied_domains`
This folder contains a JSON file named `studied_domains.json`, which includes all the e-shop domains we visited to collect the data that contributed to our research.

### 2. `crawler`
In this folder, you will find the semi-automated tool we created, written in JavaScript. This tool was developed to visit e-shops and collect the data used in our analysis.

### 3. `other_industries_experiment`
This folder contains JSON files for each of the five categories used in our first experiment. This experiment compared data collected from different industries with that of the e-shop industry.
